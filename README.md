# library
1) npm install
2) npm start
3) Build the books batabase locally, navigate to localhost:4000/admin.
4) FYI--Only "Home" and "Books" nav links are functional. "Read More" is functional only on first two books on book page. Authentication has been disabled to allow ease of navigation without first creating an account--this can be re-enabled by uncommenting lines 68, 70, 71, 72 on bookController.js.
5) UPDATE--v1.1.0--Added images to "Library" page.
